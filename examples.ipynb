    "# US Jobs Data Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This project downloads and collates/curates data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) using data from the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to highlight and make accessible the excellent work of the people at BLS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the BLS OES dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The OES dataset is remarkable, containing data for around 1,000 different occupations at national, state, and city levels. Data on numbers of jobs and pay statistics are collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BLS does maintain an API which can be accessed by using a free access code: https://www.bls.gov/developers/home.htm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than the API, the data from OES is available via Excel spreadsheets from a data download page: https://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm \n",
    "\n",
    "The data is also available via a web interface (https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm, for example). \n",
    "\n",
    "One benefit of this project is it makes all the data from different years available in one place, easily query-able via a SQLite interface, so that the data can be looked at as a time series, which is a very compelling way to understand these kinds of economic data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "My approach to collating this data is to download all of the excel data files and insert into a SQLite database.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenge to interpreting these data as a time series is changing data collection methods over time. For example, occupation codes changed in 2011 from using SOC 2000 codes to SOC 2010 codes. This can be addressed using the crosswalk provided by BLS. Other consistency issues are more difficult. For example Grand Rapids, MI seems to have been redistricted in 2015 as job numbers underwent a step change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historical records go back to 1988, but changing industry and area codes make curation difficult. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data downloaded encompassed by this project is as follows: state and national data is consistent back to 2001, while metro data goes back to 2005 when metro area codes changed. It may be possible to create a crosswalk to previous metro codes, which will be explored in the future.\n"
